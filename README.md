## Usage

To set up this project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afiqnik/The_Bookstore_Website.git
   cd The_Bookstore_Website
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:

   - Ensure you have a MySQL database running. If you don't have MySQL installed, you can download and install it from the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

   - **Create the Database**:

     Log into your MySQL server and create a new database:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE bookstore_db;
     ```

   - **Create the Product Table**:

     Run the `productTable.sql` script to create the necessary table. You can find this script in the repository. To execute the script, use the following command in your MySQL client or any MySQL GUI tool:

     ```sql
     USE bookstore_db;

     CREATE TABLE product (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         publisher VARCHAR(255),
         published_date DATE,
         description TEXT,
         isbn VARCHAR(13),
         page_count INT,
         print_type VARCHAR(50),
         categories VARCHAR(255),
         average_rating DECIMAL(3,2),
         ratings_count INT,
         language VARCHAR(10),
         thumbnail_url VARCHAR(255),
         small_thumbnail_url VARCHAR(255),
         list_price DECIMAL(10,2),
         retail_price DECIMAL(10,2),
         bestseller BOOLEAN,
         new_arrival BOOLEAN
     );
     ```

   - **Populate the Table (Optional)**:

     If you have any initial data to populate the table, insert it now. Here is an example of inserting a new product:

     ```sql
     INSERT INTO product (title, author, publisher, published_date, description, isbn, page_count, print_type, categories, average_rating, ratings_count, language, thumbnail_url, small_thumbnail_url, list_price, retail_price, bestseller, new_arrival)
     VALUES ('Sample Book', 'John Doe', 'Sample Publisher', '2024-01-01', 'A sample book for testing.', '1234567890123', 350, 'Hardcover', 'Fiction', 4.5, 10, 'en', 'http://example.com/thumbnail.jpg', 'http://example.com/small_thumbnail.jpg', 19.99, 17.99, true, true);
     ```

   - **Update the application.properties file**:

     Update the `application.properties` file located in `src/main/resources` with your database credentials. Here is an example configuration:

     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bookstore_db
     spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     ```

     Replace `your_db_username` and `your_db_password` with your actual MySQL credentials.

3. **Run the Application**:

   Use the following command to run the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:

   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the application running.
