## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afiqnik/The_Bookstore_Website.git
   cd The_Bookstore_Website
   ```

2. **Install Docker Desktop** (instead of MySQL)

   Since this project now uses Docker Compose, install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and ensure it is running.

3. **Start the Database with Docker Compose**:

   The database credentials are already configured in the docker-compose.yml file, so there is no need to modify them.

     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```

   This will start the MySQL database inside a container.

4. **Configure the Application**:

   The application is configured to connect to the local MySQL   database started by Docker. No additional configuration is needed, but if you want to manually update the properties, they can be found in `src/main/resources/application-local.properties`.

5. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:

   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
## Deployment

The application is deployed using Railway for the backend and AlwaysData for the database.
