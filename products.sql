The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr. Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France\'s suffering under the Nazi occupation, and a timeless story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence.','9780679720218',312,'[\"Fiction\"]','en','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',345.2,289.7,0,1),(2,'The Odyssey of Homer','Homer','Bantam Classics','2005-12-06 00:00:00.000000','Homer\'s epic chronicle of the Greek hero Odysseus\' journey home from the Trojan War has inspired writers from Virgil to James Joyce.

Set against the backdrop of the devastating global recession, and pulsing with the energy of Auster\'s previous novel Invisible, Sunset Park is as mythic as it is contemporary, as in love with baseball as it is with literature.

Casement had dedicated his extraordinary life to improving the plight of oppressed peoples around the world—especially the native populations in the Belgian Congo and the Amazon—but when he dared to draw a parallel between the injustices he witnessed in African and American colonies and those committed by the British in Northern Ireland, he became involved in a cause that led to his imprisonment and execution. Ultimately, the scandals surrounding Casement\'s trial and eventual hanging tainted his image to such a degree that his pioneering human rights work wasn\'t fully reexamined until the 1960s.

His life is like a room seen through the eyes of other people. This Xist Classics edition has been professionally formatted for e-readers with a linked table of contents.

It charts the emotional development of protagonist Elizabeth Bennet, who learns the error of making hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between the superficial and the essential. The comedy of the writing lies in the depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the British Regency period.Mr. Bennet of the Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is entailed, meaning that none of the girls can inherit it. His wife has no fortune, so it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well in order to support the others upon his death. Jane Austen\'s opening line, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,\" is a sentence filled with irony and playfulness. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not simply for money, despite the social pressures to make a good (i.e., wealthy) match.Pride and Prejudice has long fascinated readers, consistently appearing near the top of lists of \"most-loved books\" among both literary scholars and the general public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and paved the way for many archetypes that abound in modern literature.[1][better source needed] For more than a century, amateur and professional dramatic adaptations, print continuations and sequels, and film and TV versions of Pride and Prejudice have reimagined the original novel\'s memorable characters and themes to reach mass audiences.The 2005 film, Pride & Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen is the most recent Hollywood adaptation of the book.................

And in Slowness, Vera, the author’s wife, says to her husband: “you’ve often told me you meant to write a book one day that would have not a single serious word in it…I warn you: watch out. Your enemies are lying in wait.” Kundera is finally and fully realizing his old aesthetic dream in this novel that we could easily view as a summation of his whole work. A strange sort of summation.

It originally appeared in poem format, written in the rhythmic dactylic hexameter format, and tells the story of the ten year siege of the city of Troy during the Trojan War. By way of flashbacks and background setting, the work is the main source of many great legends of Greek mythology, including the cause of the war (the lover Paris and his stolen bride, the half-goddess Helen of Troy), the epic battle between the half-god warrior Achilles and the Trojan hero Hector following the death of Patroclus, the sack of Troy, and, of course, the death of Achilles through his one vulnerable spot-his heel. Other famous characters who appear in this epic work include Agamemnon, the King of Mycenae and leader of the Greeks; Odysseus, King of Ithaca; the warrior Ajax, Menelaus, King of Sparta, husband of Helen and brother of Agamemnon; Nestor, King of Pylos, and trusted advisor to Agamemnon; Priam, King of Troy; and Hecuba, Priam\'s wife. Numerous gods and goddesses also make their appearance, interfering in the events as their favorites engage each other in battle. The Iliad was regarded as a cultural treasure in the time of Classical Greece and its importance did not diminish with time. The Renaissance allowed its appearance in Western Europe and it has remained an important part of European culture and heritage for nearly three millennia.

Poets, novelists and writers have once again collaborated with people who have experienced detention, their tales appearing alongside first-hand accounts by people who themselves have been detained. What we hear in these stories are the realities of the hostile environment, the human costs of a system that disregards rights, that denies freedoms and suspends lives. ‘We hear so many of the wrong words about refugees – ugly, limiting, unimaginative words – that it feels like a gift to find here so many of the right words which allow us to better understand the lives around us, and our own lives too.’ – Kamila Shamsie All profits go to the Gatwick Detainee Welfare Group and Kent Help for Refugees.','9781912697120',234,'[\"Fiction\"]','en','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kmWbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',38,40.6,0,0),(53,'Fallen Too Far','Abbi Glines','Simon and Schuster','2014-03-04 00:00:00.000000','Blaire Wynn left her small farmhouse in Alabama after her mother passed away to move in with her father and his new wife in their sprawling beach house along the Florida Gulf Coast.

Set in Paris in 1819, it follows the intertwined lives of three characters: the elderly doting Goriot, a mysterious criminal-in-hiding named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac. Originally published in serial form during the winter of 1834-1835, Le Père Goriot is widely considered Balzac\'s most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac\'s fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext. The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought profound changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters - especially young Rastignac, who grew up in the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions. The novel was released to mixed reviews. Some critics praised the author for his complex characters and attention to detail; others condemned him for his many depictions of corruption and greed. A favorite of Balzac\'s, the book quickly won widespread popularity and has often been adapted for film and the stage. It gave rise to the French expression \"Rastignac\", a social climber willing to use any means to better his situation. (wikipedia.org) About the author: Honoré de Balzac born Honoré Balzac; (20 May 1799 - 18 August 1850) was a French novelist and playwright. The novel sequence La Comédie humaine, which presents a panorama of post-Napoleonic French life, is generally viewed as his magnum opus. Owing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society, Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature. He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters; even his lesser characters are complex, morally ambiguous and fully human. Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well; the city of Paris, a backdrop for much of his writing, takes on many human qualities. His writing influenced many famous writers, including the novelists Émile Zola, Charles Dickens, Marcel Proust, Gustave Flaubert, and Henry James, and filmmakers François Truffaut and Jacques Rivette. Many of Balzac\'s works have been made into films and continue to inspire other writers. James called him \"really the father of us all.\" An enthusiastic reader and independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble adapting to the teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed in the world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience. Balzac suffered from health problems throughout his life, possibly owing to his intense writing schedule. His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he lost more than one friend over critical reviews. In 1850, Balzac married Ewelina Hańska (née Contessa Rzewuska), a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love. He died in Paris six months later.

These stories crackle with as much life and intensity as ever. Rudyard Kipling pours fuel on childhood fantasies with his tales of Mowgli, lost in the jungles of India as a child and adopted into a family of wolves. Mowgli is brought up on a diet of Jungle Law, loyalty, and fresh meat from the kill. Regular adventures with his friends and enemies among the Jungle-People-cobras, panthers, bears, and tigers-hone this man-cub\'s strength and cleverness and whet every reader\'s imagination. Mowgli\'s story is interspersed with other tales of the jungle, such as \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\" lending depth and diversity to our understanding of Kipling\'s India. In much the same way Mowgli is carried away by the Bandar-log monkeys, young readers will be caught up by the stories, swinging from page to page, breathless, thrilled, and terrified.It was seven o\'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day\'s rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in the tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived. \"Augrh!\" said Father Wolf, \"it is time to hunt again\"; and he was going to spring downhill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: \"Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves; and good luck and strong white teeth go with the noble children, that they may never forget the hungry in this world.\"It was the jackal-Tabaqui, the Dish-licker-and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. They are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than any one else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of any one, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. Even the tiger hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature.

At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime.

Shelley started writing the story when she was eighteen, and the novel was published when she was twenty. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley\'s name appears on the second edition, published in France in 1823. Shelley had travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river Rhine in Germany with a stop in Gernsheim which is just 17 km (10 mi) away from Frankenstein Castle, where, two centuries before, an alchemist was engaged in experiments. Later, she travelled in the region of Geneva (Switzerland)-where much of the story takes place-and the topic of galvanism and other similar occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, Percy Shelley. Mary, Percy, Lord Byron, and John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel\'s story.','9781540801388',164,'[]','en','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXw8MQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',10,11,0,0),(105,'The Penguin Book of Classical Myths','Jennifer R.

Provided one can find such a match among the eligible persons of the opposite sex, one then hopes for “sensibility”, or capacity for emotion, so that if love is not immediately to hand, it might come around later.

When that son marries a grasping woman who convinces him that his sisters\' funds are suitable to their needs and so require no contributions from his inherited fortune, the sisters are left to play the game of “Sense and Sensibility” in earnest.But all\'s not fair in love.

No sooner has he arrived, however, than he discovers that his ex-wife is pursuing him.

After their visits, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols and newer customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London\'s street children.

The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth. The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified.

Far more immediate is the earthy life of the forest itself and the deep sensations of childhood it recalls from Grange’s memory. Ostensibly readying for war, Grange instead spends his time observing the change in seasons, falling in love with a young free-spirited widow, and contemplating the absurd stasis of his present condition. This novel of long takes, dream states, and little dramatic action culminates abruptly in battle, an event that is as much the real incursion of the German army into France as it is the sudden intrusion of death into the suspended disbelief of life.

Lime green plastic flower-shaped hair bobbles—Found, on the playing field, Derrywood Park, 2nd September. Bone china cup and saucer—Found, on a bench in Riveria Public Gardens, 31st October. Anthony Peardew is the keeper of lost things. Forty years ago, he carelessly lost a keepsake from his beloved fiancée, Therese. That very same day, she died unexpectedly. Brokenhearted, Anthony sought consolation in rescuing lost objects—the things others have dropped, misplaced, or accidently left behind—and writing stories about them. Now, in the twilight of his life, Anthony worries that he has not fully discharged his duty to reconcile all the lost things with their owners. As the end nears, he bequeaths his secret life’s mission to his unsuspecting assistant, Laura, leaving her his house and and all its lost treasures, including an irritable ghost. Recovering from a bad divorce, Laura, in some ways, is one of Anthony’s lost things. But when the lonely woman moves into his mansion, her life begins to change. She finds a new friend in the neighbor’s quirky daughter, Sunshine, and a welcome distraction in Freddy, the rugged gardener. As the dark cloud engulfing her lifts, Laura, accompanied by her new companions, sets out to realize Anthony’s last wish: reuniting his cherished lost objects with their owners. Long ago, Eunice found a trinket on the London pavement and kept it through the years. Now, with her own end drawing near, she has lost something precious—a tragic twist of fate that forces her to break a promise she once made. As the Keeper of Lost Objects, Laura holds the key to Anthony and Eunice’s redemption. But can she unlock the past and make the connections that will lay their spirits to rest?

Some of them, indeed, rolled as high as the tops of tall trees, and seemed like mountains; and the gulfs between the great billows were like deep valleys.All this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean, which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever, resulted in a terrible storm, and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many queer pranks and do a lot of damage.At the time the wind began to blow, a ship was sailing far out upon the waters. When the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and bigger the ship rolled up and down, and tipped sidewise--first one way and then the other--and was jostled around so roughly that even the sailor-men had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves from being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea.And the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn\'t get through them; so that the day grew dark as night, which added to the terrors of the storm.','9798635369456',112,'[]','en','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K1OGzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',10,12,0,0),(159,'Bartleby, The Scrivener','Herman Melville','Blurb','2019-04-29 00:00:00.000000','\"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street\" is a short story by the American writer Herman Melville, first serialized anonymously in two parts in the November and December 1853 issues of Putnam\'s Magazine, and reprinted with minor textual alterations in his The Piazza Tales in 1856.

Anthony Peardew is the keeper of lost things. Forty years ago, he carelessly lost a keepsake from his beloved fiancée, Therese. That very same day, she died unexpectedly. Brokenhearted, Anthony sought consolation in rescuing lost objects—the things others have dropped, misplaced, or accidently left behind—and writing stories about them. Now, in the twilight of his life, Anthony worries that he has not fully discharged his duty to reconcile all the lost things with their owners. As the end nears, he bequeaths his secret life’s mission to his unsuspecting assistant, Laura, leaving her his house and and all its lost treasures, including an irritable ghost. Recovering from a bad divorce, Laura, in some ways, is one of Anthony’s lost things. But when the lonely woman moves into his mansion, her life begins to change. She finds a new friend in the neighbor’s quirky daughter, Sunshine, and a welcome distraction in Freddy, the rugged gardener. As the dark cloud engulfing her lifts, Laura, accompanied by her new companions, sets out to realize Anthony’s last wish: reuniting his cherished lost objects with their owners. Long ago, Eunice found a trinket on the London pavement and kept it through the years. Now, with her own end drawing near, she has lost something precious—a tragic twist of fate that forces her to break a promise she once made. As the Keeper of Lost Objects, Laura holds the key to Anthony and Eunice’s redemption. But can she unlock the past and make the connections that will lay their spirits to rest? Full of character, wit, and wisdom, The Keeper of Lost Things is heartwarming tale that will enchant fans of The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake, Garden Spells, Mrs Queen Takes the Train, and The Silver Linings Playbook.','9780062473530',0,'[\"Fiction\"]','en','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iAT0jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',29.8,30.4,0,1),(168,'The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club','Charles Dickens','Arkose Press','2015-10-16 00:00:00.000000','This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples until they became waves, and shoved the waves around until they became billows. The billows rolled dreadfully high: higher even than the tops of houses. Some of them, indeed, rolled as high as the tops of tall trees, and seemed like mountains; and the gulfs between the great billows were like deep valleys.All this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean, which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever, resulted in a terrible storm, and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many queer pranks and do a lot of damage.At the time the wind began to blow, a ship was sailing far out upon the waters. When the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and bigger the ship rolled up and down, and tipped sidewise--first one way and then the other--and was jostled around so roughly that even the sailor-men had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves from being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea.And the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn\'t get through them; so that the day grew dark as night, which added to the terrors of the storm.','9798635369456',112,'[]','en','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K1OGzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',27.8,28.8,0,1),(170,'Bartleby, The Scrivener','Herman Melville','Blurb','2019-04-29 00:00:00.000000','\"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street\" is a short story by the American writer Herman Melville, first serialized anonymously in two parts in the November and December 1853 issues of Putnam\'s Magazine, and reprinted with minor textual alterations in his The Piazza Tales in 1856.

Erica Falck returns to her tiny, remote hometown of Fjällbacka, Sweden, after her parents’ deaths only to encounter another tragedy: the suicide of her childhood best friend, Alex. It’s Erica herself who finds Alex’s body—suspended in a bathtub of frozen water, her wrists slashed. Erica is bewildered: Why would a beautiful woman who had it all take her own life? Teaming up with police detective Patrik Hedström, Erica begins to uncover shocking events from Alex’s childhood. As one horrifying fact after another comes to light, Erica and Patrik’s curiosity gives way to obsession—and their flirtation grows into uncontrollable attraction.

The descriptions, rich in the warm colors of the South, convey Lagerlvf\'s understanding of the hot blooded Sicilians with the same insight and sympathy which she evokes while describing the introspective Swedes. Lagerlvf borrows from an ancient Sicilian legend which says, \"When Antichrist comes he shall seem as Christ. There shall be great want, and Antichrist shall go from land to land and give bread to the poor. And he shall find many followers.\" Masterfully, she intertwines a tale of modern Sicily in an era when revolutionary socialism is sweeping the island and making heavy inroads upon the influence of the church. Selma Ottiliana Lovisa Lagerlvvf (1858-1940) was born in Sweden. She had been writing poetry ever since she was a child, but she did not publish anything until 1890, when a Swedish newspaper gave her the first prize in a literary competition and published excerpts from her first novel, Gvsta Berlings Saga (published in 1891 and very successful). During her travels to Italy she wrote The Miracles of Antichrist in 1897. After several minor works she published Jerusalem (translated in English as The Holy City) but it was with The Wonderful Adventures of Nils, a book for children, that she became recognized worldwide. In 1909.she became the first woman and also the first Swedish writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.
